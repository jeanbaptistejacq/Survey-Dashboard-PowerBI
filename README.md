We are cleaning survey raw data in Power BI desktop.  Power BI dashboard breaks down the information collected in an online survey for Data Professionals. It represents the average salary by job title, level of difficulty to break into data, happiness with work/life balance, and so on.

The project deliverables consist of a PowerBI .pbix file and a PDF document.
